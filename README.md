# Tableau_visualization
As it is known, Tableau is a very useful and powerful tool for data visualization, create data interactive visualization, make the data more understandable, do analysis, create reports and identify patterns of data.
This project has allowed us to gain knowledge in Tableau and Tableau Desktop, learn the uses and some of the most important features. 

#motivation

First of all, working with Tableau for this project make us learn about this useful tool in data visualization and data analysis. Find out how to use Tableau and its features. We consider Tableau as very useful for our professional career, furthermore we are studying in this field. 
Accordingly, our main goal and first motivation is to learn about Tableau, which was completely new to us, but a real discovery.
Second, to choose a topic that is interesting for us. After doing some research to find a coherent dataset of interest that would allow us to start working with Tableau and meet the requirements for the project.

It fulfills our interests perfectly: the topic of climate change and the structure of the dataset source is very complete but not too difficult to understand with technical fields and difficult concepts. 

One of the strong points in climate change worldwide agenda is to reduce CO2 emissions.
As it is known, one way to achieve this goal is to change the form of energy production from
3.  FROM NON-RENEWABLE TO RENEWABLE ENERGY. 

All economies (poor, rich or developing) are totally dependent on non-renewable energy, mainly fossil fuels. However, this situation will not change until the renewable energy production will be enough to satisfy the energy demand of the countries. 

As we can see in the daily news, media, energy companies, measures of future governments ... speak that the renewable energy source has increased. 
Measures that directly affect the citizens in the short, medium and long term, such as buying an electric car, or hiring an electricity company in which percentage uses wind and solar energy...
From a skeptical point of view, based on how the world economy is structured, the actions are not enough at the moment to generate enough clean energy for the high demand or at least a high percentage in a time soon.

 Therefore, based on a reliable dataset, our aim is to check if this transformation is real, as it is being done.
